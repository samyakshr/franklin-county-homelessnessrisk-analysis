# Franklin County Eviction & Social Vulnerability Analysis

![Bivariate Map of Franklin County Eviction and Social Vulnerability Analysis](images/Screenshot.png)

## Overview

This project creates an interactive bivariate map showing eviction rates (per 1,000 residents) and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) data for Franklin County, Ohio census tracts. The application allows users to explore the spatial distribution of eviction activity and its relationship to social vulnerability factors, providing a tool for identifying high-risk areas and planning community interventions.

**This is a work in progress project.** The analysis and application are being actively developed and refined.

## Impact on Community Interventions

This analysis provides insights for organizations like Smart Columbus and other nonprofits working to address housing instability and homelessness prevention. By identifying census tracts with high eviction rates combined with high social vulnerability, these organizations can:

- Focus resources on areas with both high eviction rates and high SVI scores to maximize impact.
- Use spatial data to guide program design and identify opportunities for collaborative service delivery.
- Deploy proactive interventions like legal aid, rental assistance, and tenant education in high-risk communities.
- Support policy, advocacy, and grant applications with clear, data-driven evidence of need and changing conditions.
- Prioritize interventions based on standardized eviction rates that account for population size differences.

## Data Sources

### Eviction Data
- **Source**: Franklin County Court System
- **Processed by**: Samyak Shrestha
- **Coverage**: Franklin County, Ohio monthly eviction filings
- **Time Period**: July 2024 - June 2025 (12 months)
- **Processing**: Aggregated by census tract and converted to rates per 1,000 residents

### Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)
- **Source**: CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index
- **Coverage**: Franklin County, Ohio

### Population Data
- **Source**: U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS)
- **Coverage**: 5-Year Estimates (2019-2023)
- **Geographic Unit**: Census Tract level
- **File**: `ACSDT5Y2023.B01003-Data.csv`

### Geographic Data
- **Source**: Franklin County SVI Data (ESRI Shapefile)
- **Coverage**: Franklin County census tracts

### Nonprofit Organizations
- **Source**: Human Services Chamber of Franklin County, The Columbus Foundation
- **Processed and Geocoded by**: Samyak Shrestha and Ayaz Hyder
- **Coverage**: Franklin County, Ohio
- **Total Organizations**: 1,342 nonprofit locations
- **Geographic Unit**: Point locations

## Data Limitations 

This analysis captures eviction court filings (not actual evictions) and uses SVI as a composite vulnerability measure. The temporal gap between 2022 SVI data and 2024-2025 eviction data can reveal areas where recent patterns differ from historical vulnerability trends, indicating emerging risks or successful interventions. The bivariate classification uses relative thresholds based on median values and shows spatial relationships rather than causal connections. 

The analysis now includes population data to calculate standardized eviction rates per 1,000 residents, eliminating bias from tract size differences. Use this analysis alongside local knowledge and additional data sources for comprehensive community planning.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (recommended)

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Process the data** (first time only):
   ```r
   source("scripts/process_eviction_data_12months.R")
   ```

2. **Launch the Shiny app**:
   ```r
   source("scripts/hRisk_app.R")
   ```
   
   Or from terminal:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e "shiny::runApp('scripts/hRisk_app.R', port = 3838, launch.browser = TRUE)"
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:XXXX` (port shown in terminal)

## Data Processing

The application includes a data processing script (`scripts/process_eviction_data_12months.R`) that:

1. Loads raw eviction data from CSV
2. Filters for the past 12 months (July 2024 - June 2025)
3. Aggregates filings by census tract
4. Merges with SVI data and geographic boundaries
5. Creates normalized values for mapping
6. Exports processed data to CSV
